EasterStories18.
Day One.

I don't have a definition for pain. But I do know that some pains are more painful than others. And pain comes in degrees.

Jesus was betrayed by one of his disciples, but remember that it was never recorded that Judas ever had a word of praise for either Jesus or His ministry.

What about the crowd, however?
Mark records that they had echoed in their large number "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in name of The LORD" (Mark 11:9 NKJV)
...four chapters later, Mark tells us that they 'cried out again, "Crucify Him!"' (Mark 15:13)

Isn't it greater pain when those who supported you in their fullness yesterday, turn against you today?

•The husband who stood before all of God's people to pledge lifelong loyalty to you, now coming with his maids into your matrimonial bed.
••The board who promoted you just last month may affect you with their downsizing tomorrow.
•The voices that call you to lead today, may call for your head tomorrow.
We're all victims...

What's the lesson this evening?
Men mutate. We all change.
But God doesn't change. He won't.

The cheers of men today, may turn to condemnation tomorrow.
The approval of men today, may turn to attack tomorrow.

There are still trustworthy fellows... But God is most dependable.

Good evening.
